Otherwise, we will not be able to continue the installation process. When you click the box, the "Customize Options" and "Next" buttons at the bottom will be active. If we want to change and customize some installation settings, we press the "Customize Options" button. If we want to install it without making any setting changes, we press the "Next" button and proceed. After pressing the Next button, we go directly to the loading screen.

If Splunk will only run on a single server and only needs to access resources on the local system, the "Local System" account can be used. If Splunk needs to retrieve data from multiple servers or remote systems, a domain account can be used. This is suitable for installations that require access to other devices on the network. Here we will click on the "Local System" option and proceed.
